- Proper error handling (network failures, rate limiting, invalid API responses)
- Race condition handling
- Empty state and no results handling with helpful messaging
- Robust API Handling — implemented custom Axios helpers for:
  - Request cancellation — to prevent race conditions when users search quickly

  - Centralized error handling — for network errors, invalid responses, and API errors
  - This ensures smoother user experience even when the API is slow or temporarily unavailable
